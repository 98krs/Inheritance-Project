# Inheritance-Project

Learning objectives: 
   - Review basic Java class and object constructs. 
   - Demonstrate the properties of inheritance, encapsulation, static variables, and overriding methods. 
   - Practice writing classes, and using an array to store objects.

For this assignment: 
You will be creating classes to support coursework business functions. You will create a parent/super class structure for items and two related subclass structures. 
You will store created subclass objects in arrays. You will also create objects of the super class. Your program will use an overridden print method (your own print 
method in the superclass and overridden in the subclasses, not just an overridden toString) to display the items to the screen (nicely formatted and labeled) 
and the number of subclass objects created (your static variable). 

Specific requirements: 
1) Create a super class for shared attributes of items and a superclass print method. 
   One of the attributes must be "private" and the superclass must have a setter and getter for that attribute. 
2) Create two subclasses with at least 2 unique attributes. 
   Include an overridden print method, remember you must use a "getter" to obtain values for a private attribute. 
3) In addition to writing a default constructor, define and demonstrate an overloaded constructor that initializes all attributes when creating a superclass 
   or subclass object.
4) In the main program, instantiate and initialize at least one superclass object. Remember that you need to use a "setter" to initialize a private superclass 
   attribute.
5) Instantiate and initialize at least 3 subclass objects of each type. Use a separate array to store the objects for each subclass.
6) Display all the superclass and subclass objects to the screen with all attributes using the super and overridden print methods you created.
7) Display (formatted and labeled) the total number of subclass objects created.

Demonstrate both subclasses.
